 Explanation:  

This Java program uses a for loop to create a mathematical growth pattern. The program begins by initializing the ‘i’ variable to one, and the loop continues to run for as 
long as the value of the ‘i’ variable stays below five thousand. After every run, the program updates the value of the 'i' variable by performing the formula: i = 2*i + 1. 
The value of the 'i' variable increases very quickly because it is doubled and added one. After each calculation with the formula the program prints, “Count is: + the value 
of the 'i' variable.” The loop stops at the value of 4,095, because the next value would be greater than five thousand, which leads to the completion of the program.
